  # These are common tasks that are included in Autosubmit workflows
  # and executed before the SIM (Simulation) task runs.
  # You could also have a SYNC/SYNCHRONIZE task that copies code to
  # the remote platform, for instance.
  # For the sake of simplicity, this workflow only runs the model.

  # This simulation task has no other dependencies, but you could add
  # some task executed before it runs, or chain one simulation task
  # with another (common in chunking, used in climate/weather workflows).
  # e.g.
  #
  # DEPENDENCIES: INI SIM-1
  # RUNNING: chunk

  # This is just an example of how things are chained/connected in
  # Autosubmit, showing that once SIM finishes, Autosubmit will run
  # CLEAN, which could, for instance, clean temporary files.
